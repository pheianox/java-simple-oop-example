# Java OOP Example
A very simple example that shows some main concepts of the Object-Oriented programming in Java. 

- [x] Abstraction
- [x] Encapsulation
- [x] Inheritance
- [ ] Polymorphism

It's made for beginner programmers because of its light syntax. There's no clean code and any refactoring processes, but just the basics.


## Usage
1. Compile `javac Main.java`
2. Run `java Main`
